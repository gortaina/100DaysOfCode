At the request of an NGO, which had its infrastructure destroyed by lightning, it pulverized the telephone exchange.
. 
After cleaning the rack, servicing the servers / switches / consoles, replacing the UPS's batteries and redoing the network, as well as removing all the soot, the equipment was restored and returned to operation.
. 
I did the entire service free of charge and even offered advice for them to use Google Cloud. 
.
Note: Dell's Power Edge server has withstood the fire! Same with the melted plastic parts. Wow! .
